Hello! If you're reading this, you've been elected President of the WDDA! Congratulations! This document will explain and go over some of the basics of being the President and some notices and things to look out for. This document will be broken down into a few sections. <a href="#primary">**Primary Roles**</a>, <a href="#secondary">**Secondary Roles**</a>, <a href="#notes">**Notes for new Presidents**</a>, and <a href="#elections">**Elections**</a>. There may also be some other notes sprinkled throughout the document for reference. We hope you enjoy the new position!

â€” Jacob Garwood (Former President)

## <a name="primary"></a>Primary Roles
As the President, your main role is to guide the WDDA as a student organization. Before you can do that, though, there are a few things you have to do first:
### 1. Re-Register the WDDA
IU policy requires us to re-register our student organization every year. Before starting any events, make sure to <a href="https://studentlife.indiana.edu/involvement-belonging/student-involvement-leadership/student-organizations/manage-organization/reregister.html">re-register.</a> Make sure to update the Constitution with any new information!
### 2. Once the WDDA is re-registered, update the roster
You will need to update the roster to represent the current officer statuses. To do that, enter The Spot, and click on the organization, then on Roster. After that, search for the **former officers** and change their role to *Member*. Then, find your **current officers** and change their role to the role that they were elected into.  

Once these 2 things are finished, then you can start planning your Callout Meeting!
***

### Callout Meeting
Your Callout Meeting is your first official meeting of the school year. It's mainly intended to draw in new people and get them excited about the WDDA! There's a million different ways to do it, so get creative and ask your fellow officers for help!

#### NOTE: As an organization, you are allotted a certain amount of money from the school each semester for paying for amenities like food and beverage. Discuss with your Treasurer if you plan on buying food for specific events!

It's important to get the word out about your organization and get people interested in the club. Look into various Student Organization fairs and see about tabling a few of them to spread the word!

### General Role
As the President, you oversee the various other officer positions and work with them to run the WDDA. All of them are important to making the organization function properly, but there are 3 that are considered the "executive" roles:

- The President (That's you!)
- The Vice President (Similar in duty to your position. Responsible for holding events and meetings if you are unable to attend. Your right hand!)
- The Treasurer (Responsible for handling the budget and applying for any funding.)

While the other roles are not executive, they are just as important! These include:

- Risk Manager (needs to fill out a form before any meetings outside of campus. Depending on events, may not be necessary, so in that case, may use as a floating officer position to fill any gaps.)
- Reservationist (Responsible for planning events in The Spot and making sure that attendance is taken for any events)
- Front-End Representative (Liasion for the Front-End aspect of the organization. Will give ideas and feedback to help with the group's image)

**NOTE: Don't Overstress Yourself!!! Your officers are there to help the organization as a whole, so depend on them to get work done!**
***
### Meetings
In order to make sure the organization is being held smoothly, officer meetings must be held to discuss ideas, delegate work, and other organization opportunities.  Generally, these meetings should be held at **least** once every other week, so that other officers are able to stay on track. Make sure that you plan a date and time that works for all of your officers!

The general meetings for all members are usually open to the Officers' discretion. Some ideas for meetings include:

 - Speaker Events
 - Code Jams
 - Seasonal Events
 - Workshops

However, feel free to do other ideas! You're only limited by your imagination.

## <a name="secondary"></a>Secondary Roles

As the President, if there are other duties that cannot be filled by other officers, it is your responsibility to take care of them. These include:

 - Social Media Coverage
 - Taking point in discussions
 - Delegating as needed
 - Being the main point of contact with third party representatives
 - And more!
 
 If needed, you are able to assign some of these tasks to your fellow officers! However, keep in mind:
 
 **Play to your officers' strengths!**

Some officers are more able to do certain tasks than others, and in doing so, will be able to help out the organization as a whole. Make sure that your officers are able to do what you ask them!

## <a name="notes"></a>Notes for New Presidents
This is an ever-changing list of notes left from Presidents Prior. In it will be handy tips and tricks for you to use to help your journey as the President!

 - **Your Faculty Advisor is here to help. Don't be afraid to go to them with any questions!**
 - **With Speaker Events, shoot for the moon! You'd be surprised how many big names are willing to help inspire young developers!**
 - **Collaborate, Collaborate, Collaborate! Try to reach out to other organizations and see if you can do a joint project together!**
 - **Delegate before Overstressing. Don't be afraid to give work to your officers if you're starting to be overstressed. Take care of yourself!**
 - **In addendum to the previous one, Take Responsibility. At the end of the day, you are the President, and you have a certain responsibility for this organization. Make sure that you are not pushing all of your work off onto other students and stressing them out as well.**
 
 - **If there is any conflict that arises from the organization, don't be afraid to talk to the Faculty Advisors. They are here to help you!**
 
 But most importantly,
 ### NEVER STOP IMPROVING!!!
Times change, and so do we. If you see an opportunity to improve the organization that isn't listed in this document or the Constitution, be a trendsetter!! 

## <a name="elections"></a>Elections
Elections should be held in the spring semester, and generally last all semester long. From then, members are allowed to run for any of the officer positions. Make sure that if you are planning on running that you **follow the Constitution** and don't run for longer than you are allowed.

When a new President is chosen, make sure that all affairs are in order for you to transition power. That includes the most important thing in this document.

### EDIT THIS DOCUMENT!!

If there is any pertinent information, or more tricks that you want the future president to learn, put it in here!!  It's a simple markdown file, so editing it should be a breeze! We want the WDDA to last for years, so make sure that the future President is entering with more information than you started with!

***
That's it! As long as you are able to follow the guidelines and learn from this document, you should be ready to be the new President! If you have any questions, reach out to either the former President or the Faculty Advisor!  We hope you do well in your new role!
