# WDDA Secretary Transition Document

---

Congratulations! You have been elected as the Secretary for the Web Design and Development Association at IU Indy! This organization is great for letting web designers and developers experiment with extracurricular projects, framework/library studies, and networking with fellow devs. As a Secretary, you'll help the WDDA Executive Board and members come together to achieve these goals.

This document is made to help you hit the ground running from your first meeting as a Secretary. Feel free to edit, update, and improve this document to help yourself and future Secretaries as the WDDA grows and evolves.

-- Cameron Crosby (Secretary 2024-25)

## Primary Role

---

Your main role as a Secretary is to reserve rooms and track attendance as they are needed for meetings and events.

### Reserving Rooms / Register Org Events

To register events (on or off campus), go to the [WDDA's Spot page](https://thespot.iupui.edu/organization/wdda). From here, go to "Manage Organization/Organization Tools/Events" and Create Event.

You'll need some information to create events:

- Room requests or off-campus location (both will require about a week for approval)
- Any external resources:
  - Food
    - Where is the food from?
    - How much does it cost?
  - How many attendees will there be?
    - If less than 50, you can essentially ignore this.
    - If more than 50, you need to get approval from UERC before submitting this event request.
      - You can apply for UERC approval [here](https://universityevents.iu.edu/events/event-guidance-registration.html?_ga=2.241560706.1004995205.1705413323-715004064.1661439334&_gl=1*5drm0o*_ga*Nzc1NDExODIuMTcwOTIzNjc4OQ..*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTc0MDQyNDU4Ny42LjEuMTc0MDQyNTczMi40My4wLjA.)

### Ensuring/Tracking Attendance

The Spot requires us to track attendance at our events. Whenever using the Spot to organize events (even general meetings), get a head count of attendance.

In a similar vein Secretaries are responsible for notifying members and even non-members of upcoming meetings/events. Use the WDDA discord or the Spot to advertise, and when hosting speaker events or similar high-calibre events, print fliers/notices to distribute (the other officers can of course help/handle this duty).

Also, take meeting minutes at officer meetings and make sure to share them with the other officers. A lot gets planned and proposed, and minutes ensure we can all circle back to good ideas at a later date.

## Get Creative

Secretary duties don't have to start and end with reservations and meeting reminders. The WDDA benefits from creative expression and appealing events. Try engaging members or future members with creative challenges, insightful speaker events, and ways to improve as devs outside of course curricula.

Some Examples from this past year:

- Large-scale project work
  - The WDDA worked on a project for the Game Developer's Group
- Speaker Engagements
  - We had an alumnus give a seminar about React.js
  - We had a Lilly software engineer give a presentation on a "day in the life" as a dev at Lilly
- Challenges
  - We had blind code jams
  - We proposed a "lock-in" overnight code jam/project work night
- Cross-organization events
  - We are working with the Hiking Club to put on a "Touch Grass" event

## Elections

Elections take place in the spring semester. Work with the president to start gauging member interest early, because the due date for elections catches up to you quick.

If you are leaving office and transitioning power to a new Secretary, ensure a smooth transition by passing on this document and any relevant information (discord, the Spot, etc.).

### Edit This Document!

As the organization grows, its needs will as well. If the information provided in this document is not sufficient for the WDDA as it stands, feel free (or better yet, encouraged!) to edit and provide better insights and resources.
