# WDDA Treasurer Transition Document

---

Congratulations! If you're reading this, **YOU** have been selected as Treasurer for the WDDA!! Congratulations on the position- I hope you're excited!

This document has everything you need to help set you up for success as Treasurer. The roles and responsibilities of this role changed the most due to it's reliance on The Spot and submitting requests- don't be intimidated and follow this document for the basics!

-- Jeremy Black (Treasurer 2024-25)

## Primary Role

---

Your main role as Treasurer is to place funding requests through the Luddy Student Council (LSC). Additionally, you should be attending regular LSC Meetings to stay updated on new procedures, relay upcoming WDDA information, and keep in the know with other Luddy orgs.

### Funding Requests

A bulk of your role takes place on The Spot, specifically within [LSC's page](https://thespot.indianapolis.iu.edu/organization/icsc). To get access to these forms, you must first be a registered member of LSC- make sure you hit the big blue "JOIN" button **EARLY** as an LSC executive member first has to confirm you to grant you access.

There are two different types of funding requests you can place: a Funding Request and a Reimbursement Request. Funding Requests certify that LSC approves the WDDA to spend the money, and a Reimbursement Request certifies the spent money will be reimbursed through the purchasee's IU Bursar account. **Funding Requests MUST be filed first as the purchases MUST be approved by the LSC first for them to reimburse later.**

In order to be approved, Funding Requests can only be approved if the event is registered on The Spot **TWO WEEKS** before it occurs. **To file a Funding Request, you'll need lots of information:**

- Type of purchase (event-based for a specific event, item-based for merch items, equipment, or conferences)
  - _We never filed an item-based request, so all the below information is for an event-based request only. Sorry about that!_
- Date, time frame, and location of event
- Purpose of event
- Estimate of attendees
- If the event is approved on The Spot
  - If the event IS approved, you'll be asked to send a link to the event from our Spot page and submit a screenshot of the email approving the event.
- All requested purchases
- In order to get approved as fast as possible, having a **COMPLETE** list with the names of items and their prices should be included in the text box.

Reimbursement Requests are only approved for events who have approved Funding Requests. **They thankfully ask you for a lot less information:**

- Event information
  - Name, date, time, location, etc.
- Date the Funding Request was **APPROVED**
- Amount of money to be reimbursed (in USD)
- Photos of receipts for the purchases made
- Names and IU emails of attendees (for event-based purchases)
- Name, IU email, student ID and mailing address of officer who made the purchase
  - This last bullet asks a LOT- for everyone's sake, have this information from the purchasee ready when starting the request OR do the purchasing yourself!

As you may have noticed, student orgs don't get a P-Card or any special physical money to make payments with. **Unfortunately, the way this system works is that someone will have to pay for these items OUT OF POCKET once the funds are approved before LSC reimburses them through the IU Bursar account.**

For food items, as of 2024-25 you will get into contact with Nancy Barker through email to request a catering order after the funds are approved, place the call/order with the Luddy School as the name, and keep the receipt for Nancy to reference. In the future, it may not be Nancy taking these requests; when ordering food for the first time, don't be afraid to email the LSC Treasurer and ask who the point of contact is for catering.

### Luddy Student Council Meetings

In order for the WDDa to receive $600 each semester, **AT LEAST ONE MEMBER** from each Luddy org **_MUST_** attend LSC general meetings. Since these meetings go over LSC updates in regards to funding or upcoming benchmarks, this will likely be **YOU!** YAY!

As of 2024-25, all meetings begin with attendance with the LSC executive leading the meeting going down the list of orgs by name. **IN ORDER TO GET FUNDING, WE MUST BE MARKED PRESENT FOR EACH MEETING!** From there, the exec leading the meeting may have updates or news for the orgs such as upcoming LSC events or funding reminders, but most meetings move into the last phase where the representatives from each org can share upcoming events/flyers or things they're working on. This is a good time to boost WDDA and/or see what cool things other Luddy groups are up to- pay attention!

As of 2024-25, the meeting times unfortunately changed a **LOT.** Meetings went from every other Friday to monthly on Fridays, being cancelled at random (which is problematic when you only have 1 meeting per month!). I desperately hope things are more streamlined for you next year.

Again, only ONE rep needs to attend for funding- if you can't make the regular meeting time or won't be around one meeting day, you can always contact another WDDA officer to attend in your stead. (_I'll be the Vice President next year and I know how the meetings operate- tap me in if needed!_)

If you ever have any questions about LSC processes, these meetings are good times to ask.

## Get Inventive

As Treasurer, you have around $600 each semester to budget. We never got **CLOSE** to that amount- if you're looking to take advantage of our moolah, **here are some ideas:**

- WDDA merch
  - Shirts! Hats! Pins! You get the jist!
- Conferences
  - The WDDA has never been big enough for this, but you could increase membership if you promise conferences early in the year- contact our advisor Todd Shelton to see what we can set up!
- Bigger catering orders
  - If you're planning for bigger events, get bigger food portions! Any student will come out to an event with the promise of food- even better if there are leftovers!

If you've spent quite a lot of dough in the year- I'm glad you're getting good use out of it! Unfortunately, you're probably urgently looking for some ways to save money or not spend as much on an upcoming event. No worries! **Here are some tips if you find you've spent a bit too much of the budget:**

- Buy in bulk early, save the leftovers!
  - If buying utensils like cups or plates, save whatever is leftover from events in MEDL for later use! This way, you don't have to spend money on these items in the future.
- Check in clearance
  - If planning holiday events (Halloween, winter-themed, etc.) it's likely themed decor or items for the season will be pricer than normal. Always check around the "clearance" aisle or grab smaller variations of decorations to save $5-10!
- Buy generic
  - Red solo cups and paper plates will go a long way! Don't be afraid of "cheaping out." It's cost-effective!

## Elections

Elections take place in the spring semester. Work with the president to start gauging member interest early, because the due date for elections catches up to you quick.

If you are leaving office and transitioning power to a new Secretary, ensure a smooth transition by passing on this file and any other relevant information (Discord, the Spot, etc.).

### Edit This Document!
