Hello! If you're reading this, you've been elected President of the WDDA! Congratulations!

There may also be some other notes sprinkled throughout the document for reference. We hope you enjoy the new position!

â€” Jacob Garwood (Former President)

## <a name="primary"></a>Primary Roles
As the President, your main role is to guide the WDDA as a student organization. Before you can do that, though, there are a few things you have to do first:
### 1. Re-Register the WDDA
IU policy requires us to re-register our student organization every year. Before starting any events, make sure to <a href="https://studentlife.indiana.edu/involvement-belonging/student-involvement-leadership/student-organizations/manage-organization/reregister.html">re-register.</a> Make sure to update the Constitution with any new information!
### 2. Once the WDDA is re-registered, update the roster
You will need to update the roster to represent the current officer statuses. To do that, enter The Spot, and click on the organization, then on Roster. After that, search for the **former officers** and change their role to *Member*. Then, find your **current officers** and change their role to the role that they were elected into.  

Once these 2 things are finished, then you can start planning your Callout Meeting!

### Callout Meeting
Your Callout Meeting is your first official meeting of the school year. It's mainly intended to draw in new people and get them excited about the WDDA! There's a million different ways to do it, so get creative and ask your fellow officers for help!

#### NOTE: As an organization, you are allotted a certain amount of money from the school each semester for paying for amenities like food and beverage. Discuss with your Treasurer if you plan on buying food for specific events!

It's important to get the word out about your organization and get people interested in the club. Look into various Student Organization fairs and see about tabling a few of them to spread the word!

As the President, you oversee the various other officer positions and work with them to run the WDDA. All of them are important to making the organization function properly, but there are 3 that are considered the "executive" roles:

- The President (That's you!)
- The Vice President (Similar in duty to your position. Responsible for holding events and meetings if you are unable to attend. Your Right Hand!)
- The Treasurer (Responsible for handling the budget and applying for any funding.)

While the other roles are not executive, they are just as important! These include.
